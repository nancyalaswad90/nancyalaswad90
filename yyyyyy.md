========================================



>  **I'm  Nancy**  , [Master Accountant](https://github.com/nancyalaswad90/nancyalaswad90/blob/master/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA.pdf) with more than 11 years experience working in Bank on operational & extracting data, And now she is working in AI, ML, DL, DS fields 



Now a days I am studying  [Information Technology and Computing](https://github.com/nancyalaswad90/nancyalaswad90/blob/master/second%20.md)  at Arab Open University as second Bachelor  study path and  [Medical Laboratory](https://github.com/nancyalaswad90/Medical-Laboratory/blob/main/README.md)   diploma college as third  study path.



That's why I'm excited to contribute this summer with you and I have chosen the **Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA)** cause  [Localization](https://www.vengaglobal.com/blog/translation-localization-difference/) **project** will give me a good experience  and [as defined by Stephanie Harris.](https://www.vengaglobal.com/blog/translation-localization-difference/)



 [Localization](https://www.vengaglobal.com/blog/translation-localization-difference/)  **is a more comprehensive process than translation** that addresses cultural and non-textual components as well as linguistic issues when adapting the text for another country or locale.



> **So , my aim is to gain ideas about `Localization` and use it in my study progresses and knowledge `then` share the advantages with others**
